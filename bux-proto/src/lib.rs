//! Wire protocol for bux host↔guest communication.
//!
//! Messages are serialized with [`postcard`] and framed with a 4-byte
//! big-endian length prefix, suitable for any reliable byte stream
//! (vsock, Unix socket, TCP).
//!
//! # Per-Operation Connection Model
//!
//! Each operation (exec, file read, etc.) uses its own dedicated connection.
//! The first message on every connection is a [`Hello`] that identifies the
//! operation type, followed by a [`HelloAck`] from the guest. Subsequent
//! messages are operation-specific (e.g. [`ExecIn`]/[`ExecOut`] for exec).
