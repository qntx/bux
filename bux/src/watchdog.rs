//! Watchdog pipe for parent↔shim liveness detection.
//!
//! When the parent process dies (or drops its [`Keepalive`] handle), the
//! write end of the pipe closes. The shim detects this via `POLLHUP` on
//! the read end and initiates a graceful shutdown.
//!
//! This mechanism works on **all** Unix platforms, unlike
//! `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` which is Linux-only.
